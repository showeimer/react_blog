# React Router blog

'Create a Blog application that uses React and React Router, and generates dynamic endpoints.'

## Getting Started

- To get started you will need to use create-react-app to quickly scaffold a project. You should migrate your components into a components folder in the src directory and the styles into a styles folder in the src directory. Link up all pages to make sure they working and test using npm run start in the console, use Ctrl+c to exit.

- You will need use npm install --save react-router-dom in the terminal to save React Router 4 to your project dependencies and make it available for import.

- In your index.js file, you will need to import { BrowserRouter, Route, Switch } from react-router-dom.

- You should have a layout component that renders on all pages and is nested properly within the <BrowserRouter> component.

- You should have the following separate components:
  - App.js
  - BaseLayout.js
  - CreatePost.js
  - PostList.js
  - ShowPost.js

- Your app should mimic the functionality of the example provided at the end of this document.

- You should be able to create a blog post using the tiny lasagna server for your fetch requests: https://tiny-lasagna-server.herokuapp.com/collections/blogger/.

- After you create your post, you should be redirected to the main screen of all listed blogs.

- You should be able to list all of the blog titles as <Link /> components and when you click on a title it should take you to a ShowPost component that dynamically renders with the blogs 'id' as an endpoint. You will need to use the match params object from React Router to do this. (see hints)

- The final project should be a relatively attractive mock blogging website. The content and styling are up to you.

- In the component lifecycle method generally associated with AJAX calls you should have the following code in your ShowPost component :
  - const { id } = this.props.match.params;
    const URL = `https://tiny-lasagna-server.herokuapp.com/collections/blogger/${id}`;

- The URL variable should be used to fetch the blog post with the 'id' that matches the endpoint.

- You can use this.props.history.push('/'); at the end of a fetch in your .then() methods to push to a particular endpoint, such as /.

## Results

Your project should look something like this:
